# Carotism Book Script

This Python script automates the process of writing the entire book of Carotism in a readable Minecraft book. It automatically clicks the next page button, allowing you to create the book effortlessly.

## Description

The Carotism Book Script is designed to work with Minecraft and the PyAutoGUI library. It reads the content of each page from a predefined list and simulates the mouse click to navigate through the book pages in-game. By running this script, you can quickly create the Carotism book without manually typing each page.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your system
- The PyAutoGUI library installed (`pip install pyautogui`)
- A running Minecraft game with the book UI open

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open the Minecraft game and navigate to the book UI.
3. Adjust the `pages` list in the script to include the desired content for each page.
4. Run the script (`python carotism_book.py`).
5. Position the mouse cursor over the next page button and wait for the script to start.
6. The script will automatically click the next page button and input the content of each page.
7. Sit back and let the script do the work for you.

Note: Ensure that your Minecraft window is visible and not obstructed during script execution.
